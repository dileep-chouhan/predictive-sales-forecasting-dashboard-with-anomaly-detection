# Predictive Sales Forecasting Dashboard with Anomaly Detection

## Overview

This project develops a sales performance dashboard that provides insightful visualizations of current sales data, predicts future sales trends using time series analysis, and identifies potential sales anomalies.  The dashboard facilitates proactive intervention by highlighting unusual sales patterns that may require managerial attention.  The analysis incorporates data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and anomaly detection techniques.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Statsmodels (optional, depending on the chosen forecasting model)


## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**  Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository_url>`.
2. **Install dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python libraries using: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the script:** Execute the main script using: `python main.py`

## Example Output

The script will generate the following outputs:

* **Console Output:**  Printed analysis summarizing key findings, including model performance metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE for the forecasting model) and anomaly detection results.
* **Plot Files:** Several plot files will be generated in the project directory, visualizing:
    * Current sales data (e.g., line chart showing sales over time).
    * Predicted future sales trends (e.g., line chart showing predicted sales with confidence intervals).
    * Identified sales anomalies (e.g., scatter plot highlighting anomalous data points).  File names will be descriptive (e.g., `sales_trend.png`, `sales_forecast.png`, `anomalies.png`).

**Note:** The specific output files and their names may vary slightly depending on the implementation.  Ensure that your data file is correctly placed in the project directory or that the file path is correctly specified in the `main.py` script.
